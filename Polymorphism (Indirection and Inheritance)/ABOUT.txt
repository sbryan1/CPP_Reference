C++ Polymorphism
________________________________________________________________

- a reference can refer to a derived class instance
	=> Liskov substitutability

- any base class function can be called through a base reference to a derived instance


- "virtual" function : derived class function executes
	=> polymorphism



- "nonvirtual" function : base class function executes
