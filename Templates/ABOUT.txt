Templates
__________



C++ genericity is accompilished with templates
 
 - resolved at compile time
  - no runtime checks
 
 
 
- you write a class or function once and it works with many different types
    ex) average, largest, smallest of different number data types
    ex) type safe collection


std::string   is template based
