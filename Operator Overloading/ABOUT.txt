C++ Operator Overloading
___________________________________________________________

both fundamental types and userdefined types use simple operators

ex)
_____

	/*
		you want to add an "Order" item to another using "+" similar to how 
		   int objects can be added to one another using "+"

	*/


	int i = j + 3;
	Order new Order = oldOrder + newItem;
	

_____


1. Write a function that defines the operator
2. Operator overloads start with the letters "operator"
3. State the symbol that you're overloading



- usually a member function
- ocasionally a free function
