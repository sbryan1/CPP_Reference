C++ Indirection
__________________________________________________

Reference: alias for something else
        - can only set its target when delcaring it
        - anything done to the reference is being done to the target
                -- its just another word for the same thing
        - can't change it to refer to something else

Pointers: more flexible alias for something else
        - have capabilities that refernces dont
        - can point to something that exists
        - can point to "nowhere"
        - can be made to point to something else
        - extra syntax and punction
  
        - use the ' * '  operator to get the value that it points to 
                -- aka: the dereference operator
                -- you can use ' . ' on the object after using ' * ' 
          
  
  
ex)
________

//pointer "pA" initialized to the address of integer called "A"

        int* pA = &A;         //or: int *pA = &A --- the compiler does not care which syntax you use
        *pA = 5;        //puts 5 in the address you are pointing to

ex)
______
        
  
        
        
        Person Kate("Kate", "Gregory", 234);        //declaration of a Person object called "Kate" and initalizing with constructo parameters
        Person* pKate = &Kate;        //declaration of a Person pointer called pKate and initializing to the address of "Kate"
        name = (*pKate).GetName();        //calling Person.getName() on the "Kate" object --- alternative syntax:       name = pKate->GetName();
